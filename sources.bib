  abstract         = {We investigate collective behaviour that appears in open, many-body systems of two- and four-level atoms. Here, ``open" refers to the system interacting with an external environment that causes dissipation. We derive a general open quantum master equation to describe the system dynamics only, independent of this environment. We identify processes such as coherent exchange of virtual photons and modified decay rates caused by long-range interactions between all pairs of atoms that scale with distance by inverse power laws. 

We explore excitation transport within a one-dimensional chain of atoms where the atomic transition dipoles are coupled to the free radiation field. When the interatomic spacing is smaller than or comparable to the wavelength of light associated with the photon emitted from a given transition, virtual photon exchange interactions facilitate excitation transport through the chain. Atomic systems coupled to an environment display dissipative dynamics, however subradiant transport is exhibited from a variety of initial states; spontaneous emission from the chain occurs at a rate much slower than that for an individual atom. In particular, we find a region within the decay spectrum that consists entirely of subradiant states with a corresponding linear dispersion relation in the interaction energy. Identifying this subspace allows for the dispersionless transport of wave packets over long distances with near-zero decay. Moreover, the group velocity of the wave packet and direction of the transport can be controlled via an external uniform magnetic field while preserving its subradiant character. 

We discuss a number of experimental considerations to justify the feasibility and robustness of this protocol. Initial state preparation is outlined, utilising external laser driving to excite the system into the single excitation sector. Furthermore, we consider positional disorder by explicitly accounting for the external atomic degrees of freedom -- position and momentum -- which allows us to model the positions of all atoms by a motional state representing the occupation of a lattice well with a given width. These discussions are made in the low-temperature limit, where the atomic motion is essentially frozen, and we identify that subradiant transport is indeed robust.

Finally, we explore the experimental limits of interatomic spacing and imperfect filling within an experimentally achievable optical lattice. We calculate the photon emission rate -- an experimentally measurable quantity -- and compare the emission spectra to our analysis. By limiting parameters to those achieved experimentally, we observe a reduction, yet not an absence, of collective behaviour.

The simplicity and versatility of this system, together with the robustness of subradiance against disorder, makes it relevant for a range of applications such as lossless energy transport and long-time light storage. The lifetime of an atomic excitation could be increased by a factor of thousands to millions for a chain of atoms under the conditions that we explore in this thesis.},

  abstract         = {In recent years, quantum phase transitions have attracted the interest of both theorists and experimentalists in condensed matter physics. These transitions, which are accessed at zero temperature by variation of a non-thermal control parameter, can influence the behaviour of electronic systems over a wide range of the phase diagram. Quantum phase transitions occur as a result of competing ground state phases. The cuprate superconductors which can be tuned from a Mott insulating to a d-wave superconducting phase by carrier doping are a paradigmatic example. This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Several classes of transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An interesting separate class of transitions is boundary phase transitions where only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be illustrated in a few examples. The article is aimed at bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials. It will give an overview on a variety of different quantum transitions, critically discuss open theoretical questions, and frequently make contact with recent experiments in condensed matter physics.},

They are created with a lot of energy, have unusually large size and live relatively long. They are useful because they are extremely sensitive to their environment; so much so that a single photon of light can change the behaviour of not only one, but dozens or hundreds of them, over distances we can easily see under an optical microscope. Wherever Rydberg states are created—in atoms, molecules or solids—they all share common features that are exemplified by the physical description of highly-excited hydrogen atoms, with energy levels described by the Rydberg formula.In this ebook, we outline the universal properties of Rydberg systems and then present a selection of ideas that demonstrate their increasing relevance to applications, including sensing, the manipulation of light on the single photon level (quantum optics) and in engineering the interactions between individual quanta (quantum simulation).},

quantum theory is mandatory. The lecture will try to be as self-contained as possible and aims at
providing rather recipes than proofs.},
